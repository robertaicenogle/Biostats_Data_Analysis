# Biostatistics_Paradigm
This repository follows/documents the UT Data Analytics Certificate Program. 

### Purpose
The goal is to develop a general data analytics paradigm. Throughout this process, we'll discover new programs/software, terminology, and a novel set of skills that can be applied to various projects.

## Definitions
- **Command Line** - The command line is used to navigate and perform tasks on a computer. (macOS) Terminal Application. (Windows) Command Prompt.
- **Github Repository** - 
- **Interpreter** - 
- **Git Bash** - An app for Microsoft Windows environments that installs Bash (Bourne-again shell) and Git on Windows OS.
- **Shell** - a terminal application, like Terminal on macOS, used to interface with an OS through written commands.
- 

## Let's Begin

### Opening the Terminal Application - macOS
   1. Press Command+Space to open Spotlight Search.
   2. Type "Terminal" into the search bar and press Enter.
   3. Next, select the Terminal application to launch it. You can save Terminal to your dock for easy access.

### Using the Terminal Application
The terminal on my screen shows the following:

Last login: Fri Oct  1 00:35:18 on console
daniellaandrobert@Daniellas-iMac ~ % 

The first line shows the details of the last login. The second line provides the name of the computer (in this case, daniellaandrobert@Daniellas-iMac). The second part, ~ %, has three key parts:

   1. The squiggly line, ~, is how the computer lets us know we are in the home directory.
   2. The name "daniellaandrobert" is the name of the home directory. The home directory on a Mac is the little house that appears in the sidebar of the Finder window under Favorites.
   3. The $ is what programmers call the prompt, which is where we will type commands.

### inding Your Home Directory
Every time you open the terminal application, it will open in the home directory. Using commands, we can find the terminal "path" to the home directory.

To find the path to your home directory (or any directory), enter the command pwd after the prompt, $. Then press Enter to run, or execute, the command.  **pwd** stands for "print working directory." The working directory is the current directory you are working in. For example, right now we are working in the home directory. After we run the **pwd** command, the computer responds with current folder in use.
